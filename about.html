                My name is Sarah. I am a Biology and Computer Science double major. 
                I am in my third year of collge and currently enrolled at SUNY New Paltz. 
                I have no idea what my plans after graduation are only that I'm leaning more towards my CS major.
                I do hope to move from New York and hopefully go somewhere where I'll never have to see snow again. 
                As shown on my projects page I really like video games and have started to learn how to crochet so I can make small ghost friends out of yarn.
                The story behind the picture is that my friends and I were going a environmmnetal PSA for a class. 
                One of us had the bright idea that while I was talking about waste that I should do it in a trash can.
                It seemed like a good idea until as you can see I got stuck. 
                So yes, that is my mother having to pull her, at the time, 18 year old child out of a trashcan.
